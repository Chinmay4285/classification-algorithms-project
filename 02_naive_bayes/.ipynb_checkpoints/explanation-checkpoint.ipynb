    "- It assumes that the word \"free\" appearing doesn't affect the probability of \"money\" appearing\n",
    "- In reality, \"free\" and \"money\" often appear together in spam emails\n",

    "1. **Simplifies calculation**: Instead of P(word1, word2, word3 | class), we calculate P(word1|class) × P(word2|class) × P(word3|class)\n",
    "2. **Reduces data requirements**: We don't need to see every possible combination of features\n",
