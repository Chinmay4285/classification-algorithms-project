    "## 2. How Random Forest Works: Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest combines two key randomization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each tree, create a **bootstrap sample**:\n",
    "- Randomly sample N observations **with replacement** from the original training set\n",
    "- Each tree sees a slightly different dataset\n",
    "- About 63% of original samples appear in each bootstrap sample\n",
    "- About 37% are \"out-of-bag\" (OOB) samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Feature Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "At each split in each tree:\n",
    "- Instead of considering all features, randomly select a subset\n",
    "- Typical choices: √(total_features) or log₂(total_features)\n",
    "- Find the best split among only these randomly selected features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Build Multiple Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build many decision trees (typically 100-1000)\n",
    "- Each tree is trained on different data with different feature subsets\n",
    "- Trees are typically grown deep (high variance, low bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Combine Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Classification**:\n",
    "- Each tree votes for a class\n",
    "- Final prediction = majority vote\n",
    "- Confidence = percentage of trees voting for winning class\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Regression**:\n",
    "- Each tree predicts a value\n",
    "- Final prediction = average of all predictions"
